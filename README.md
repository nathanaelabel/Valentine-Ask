## What's This?

This is a little project I made to ask my girlfriend to be my Valentine in a fun and memorable way. It's got:
- Cute "Yes" button that shows confetti and a sweet message.
- Sneaky "No" button that moves around and says funny things.
- A dancing cat and a cat with a heart because why not? 🐱❤️

4. If you click "No," well... good luck catching the button! 😂
